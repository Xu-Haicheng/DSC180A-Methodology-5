**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Cleaning the transaction memos is the most important and most interesting part of our project so far because most of the memos are extremely messy, making it difficult for any model to classify the category of a certain transaction. When cleaning the memos, we have to think about what information is useful (company names like Amazon_marketplace) and what is not (transaction IDs, for example).

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Something we haven't yet started is the process of actually obtaining a credit score for each consumer, so I would like to investigate that for my project in quarter 2. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Since our group is able to classify transactions with over 99% accuracy using TFIDF, there likely won't be any major changes to the current approach. Some minor changes we can investigate include further improving the memo cleaning process and extracting more information through transaction date and amount.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

We can test out other models and different configurations of our current model, but since we're getting such high accuracy, I don't think it's very necessary.
